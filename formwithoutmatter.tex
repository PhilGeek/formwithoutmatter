\section{Empedocles} % (fold)
\label{sec:empedocles}
In the \emph{Meno} Socrates attributes to Empedocles a conception of perception as a mode of assimilation of material effluences:
\begin{quotation}
    \textsc{meno}: And how do you define color?
    
    \ldots
    
    \textsc{socrates}: Would you like an answer in the style Gorgias, such as you most readily follow?
    
    \textsc{meno}: Of course I should.
    
    \textsc{socrates}: You and he believe in Empedocles' theory of effluences, do you not?
    
    \textsc{meno}: Wholeheartedly.
    
    \textsc{socrates}: And passages in which and through which the effluences make their way?
    
    \textsc{meno}: Yes.
    
    \textsc{socrates}: Some of the effluences fit into some of the passages whereas others are too great or too small.

% \end{quotation}

The main elements of the account are relatively clear. Objects emit material effluences. Effluences are fine bodies that are kind differentiated in terms of magnitude. There are passages in which and through which material effluences may flow. Whether a material effluence may enter a passage depends on its magnitude. The magnitudes of some kinds of material effluences are too great or too small for them to flow through a given passage. Such passages exist in the membrane of the eye, thus allowing the eye to assimilate only a certain kind of material effluence, that is, the kind whose magnitude permits entry in ocular passages.

Thus we arrive at the answer in the style of Gorgias. That answer has three components. It specifies a kind of thing and two conditions that must be satisfied for a thing of that kind to be color. Color is (1) a kind of material effluence that is (2) commensurate with sight and (3) perceptible. First, color is a kind of material effluence, a chromatic effluence, let's say. Since material effluences are kind differentiated by magnitude, chromatic effluences have a distinctive magnitude. Second, chromatic effluences are commensurate with sight insofar as their magnitude admits entry in the passages of the membrane of the the eye, the organ of sight. Notice, however, the assimilation of chromatic effluences by the organ of sight is not, by itself, the sensing of colors. Otherwise the final condition would be redundant. The assimilation of chromatic effluence is at best a material precondition for their sensing. The thought seems to be this: In order for the chromatic effluences to be the object of sense, they first must be assimilated by the organ of sensation. It is only by assimilating chromatic effluences that they are presented to sight and are thereby seen. Socrates claims that the answer in the style of Gorgias may be generalized to the other sensory objects such as sound and smell (\emph{Meno} 76\( ^{d} \), a claim echoed by Theophrastus' account of Empedocles, \emph{De Sensibus} 7). If that's right, then Empedocles, at least as presented by Socrates, is in the grip of a general conception of sensory awareness for which ingestion provides the model. Compare---in eating an olive, the matter of the olive is taken in and presented to the organ of taste and thereby tasted. On the ingestion model, to be perceptible is to be palpable to sense. Olfaction, on one conception of it at any rate, provides a complementary model---an odor is the object of smell only if the particulate matter that constitutes that odor is in contact with the nasal membrane. 

The underlying thought is that in order for something to be the object of sense, it must be present to the sense organ. On the ingestion model, it is a general feature that taste shares with paradigmatic cases of touch that is operative---the object of sensation must be in contact with the sense organ for it to be sensed. Theophrastus' commentary supports this suggestion. Following Aristotle (\emph{De Anima} \textsc{i}.2 404\( ^{b} \)12--15; cf \emph{Metaphysics} \textsc{iii}.4 1000\( ^{b} \)5--8), Theophrastus counts Empedocles as a likeness theorist---as explaining perception in terms of the similarity of the elements that compose the object of sense and the sense organ. However, in \emph{De Sensibus} 15, Theophrastus concedes that Empedocles remains silent on the compositional similarity of the material effluence and the sense organ that assimilates it, emphasizing instead the role of \emph{contact} in perception \citep{Kamtekar:2009fk,Sedley:1992uq}.


To be perceptible is to be palpable to sense. If one began with that thought, a puzzle would naturally arise about vision, for vision seems to present the colors of distant objects. Color perception seems to involve the presentation of color qualities inhering in bounded particulars located at a distance from the perceiver. But how can one assimilate what remains inherent in a bounded particular remote from one? 

I conjecture that whatever independent reasons Empedocles may have had for believing in material effluences, it is precisely this puzzlement that effluences are meant to address in his theory of vision. The basic idea is simple enough, at least in broad outline. Distant objects may be sensed by sensing the material effluences they emit. If the color of an object is the material effluence that it emits, then the color of a remote object can be assimilated and so be palpable to sight. In this way, we can see the color of a bounded particular remote from us  consistent with the constraints imposed by the ingestion model. One may wonder whether the theory of effluences is wholly adequate to this task, at least without supplementation. Thus a Berkelean worry naturally arises about the immediate objects of sensation, the assimilated effluences, screening off the external objects that emit them. Moreover, it is not just colored objects that appear at a distance, but the colors themselves seem confined to the remote bounded region in which they inhere. Fortunately, it is the puzzlement that arises from Empedocles' conception of sensory presentation, and not his resolution of it, that is our focus here. 

I believe that Empedocles' puzzlement about the sensory presentation of the remote objects of sight is a natural one. The puzzlement survives abandoning what surely is the immediate culprit in the ingestion model, the principle that to be perceptible is to be palpable to sense. Indeed, in its most general form the puzzlement persists to this day. Thus Broad remarks that:
\begin{quote}
    It is a natural, if paradoxical, way of speaking to say that seeing seems to `bring us into \emph{contact} with \emph{remote} objects' and to reveal their shapes and colors. \citep[33]{Broad:1952kx}
\end{quote}
In its most general form, the puzzlement is one aspect of the problem discussed by contemporary philosophers under the rubric of presence in absence. The puzzlement consists in an inability to understand how to coherently combine the distal character of the objects of sight with a conception of sensory awareness as a mode of assimilation. It would be premature to dismiss that conception, even in its original Empedoclean form, as primitive form of psychophysics. Indeed Aristotle retains the conception of perception as a mode of assimilation even as he transforms it in rejecting Empedocles' theory of effluences. Aristotle retains that conception presumably because he felt that there was an insight that should be preserved in Empedocles' opinion. And Aristotle is not alone in thinking that there is an insight to be preserved in conceiving of sensory awareness as a mode of assimilation. Thus \citet{Broad:1952kx} speaks of the presentation of the objects of sensory awareness as a mode of prehension.  ``Prehension'' belongs to a primordial family of broadly tactile metaphors for sensory awareness that includes ``grasping'', and ``apprehending''. What unites these metaphors is that they are all a mode of assimilation, and ``ingestion'' is a natural variant \citep[see][7]{Johnston:2006uq,Price:1932fk}. It is natural, then, to think of seeing as taking in the external scene before one. But then the question naturally arises: How can one take in what remains external? And if one can, what could taking in mean such that one could?

In \emph{De Anima} Aristotle defines perception as a mode of assimilation of the sensible form without the matter of an external particular (\emph{De Anima} \textsc{ii}.12 424\( ^{a} \); \textsc{ii}.5 417\( ^{b} \)). This is an instance of Aristotle's dialectical refinement of the \emph{endoxa}. While denying that sight involves the assimilation of material effluences, Aristotle retains Empedocles' conception of sensory awareness as a mode of assimilation, it is just that we assimilate form without matter. Indeed, this pattern of dialectical refinement continues in the very next sentence where Aristotle uses Plato's metaphor of  wax receiving an impression, not to characterize judgment as Plato does in the \emph{Theaetetus} (194\( ^{c} \)--195\( ^{a} \)), but to characterize the assimilation of sensible form in perception. Given this pattern of dialectical refinement, we can be confident that Aristotle was engaging with Empedocles' thought in his definition of perception. And while it remains controversial how to understand the assimilation of sensible form, I believe progress can be made by interpreting Aristotle's definition of perception as addressing Empedocles' puzzlement about how remote objects can be present in sensory consciousness. Recall Empedoclean puzzlement begins with the natural thought that in seeing one takes in the external scene. The question then arises: How can we take in what remains external? Assimilation is a process of internalization. But if wholly internalized, nothing external remains. The proposal is to interpret Aristotle's definition of perception as containing within it a resolution of this puzzlement---a remote object can be present in sensory consciousness by assimilating its sensible form while leaving its matter in place. Understanding how Aristotle's definition of perception could be a resolution of Empedoclean puzzlement imposes a substantive constraint on interpreting that definition. For so interpreted, it is making an important claim about the metaphysics of sensory presentation.

Aristotle's definition of perception is a dialectical refinement of the \emph{endoxa} insofar as it seeks to preserve an Empedoclean insight while resolving a puzzle about how remote objects can be present to sensory consciousness. Empedocles' puzzlement about the nature of sensory presentation persists to this day, though now in the guise of discussions of presence in absence. Perhaps there are insights of Aristotle's own that ought to be preserved when confronting Empedoclean puzzlement as it arises in its modern guise. If there are, then a conception of sensory presentation that preserved Aristotle's insight into the proper resolution of Empedoclean puzzlement would itself be a dialectical refinement of the respected opinion of Aristotle. What these insights might be and whether any conception of sensory presentation answers this description remains to be determined.

\section{Transparency} % (fold)
\label{sec:transparency}

Let's turn now to the transparent. In so doing we are jumping into the middle of things---both in the order of Aristotle's exposition, but also in that transparency is a common nature or power of the external medium that separates the perceiver and the remote object of vision.

There are philosophical reasons for considering the nature of the transparent.

First, Aristotle defines color in terms of the transparent. Specifically, in \emph{De Anima} \textsc{ii}.7 418\( ^{a-b} \) Aristotle defines color as the power to move what is actually transparent. Our understanding of color is incomplete if we do not understand the state of the external medium, such as air or water, which is a precondition for the activity of color. The effect of this incomplete understanding ramifies given Aristotle's avowed strategy of explaining perceptual capacities in terms of perceptual activities that are their exercise and to explain perceptual activities in terms of the objects of those activities.

Second, given that color is the power to move what is actually transparent, there is an alteration that the external medium undergoes when in a transparent state as a result of the activity of color. Suppose the alteration that the external medium undergoes when in a transparent state is imparted to the internal medium---the transparent medium that constitutes the interior of the sense organ, in the case of the eye, the \emph{vitreous humour}. Then we would have in place an important piece of the puzzle involved in interpreting the assimilation of sensible forms. Moreover, progress can be made here while forestalling the controversies, which must eventually be faced, surrounding the metaphysics of \emph{De Anima} \textsc{ii}.5.

Third, external particulars remote from the perceiver are arrayed in an external medium through which, when transparent, they appear. Empedoclean puzzlement highlights the way in which this is a remarkable fact. Attending to the details of Aristotle's discussion of transparency we may gain insight into his reaction to Empedoclean puzzlement about the sensory presentation of remote objects.

It is worth enumerating the reasons for considering Aristotle's discussion of transparency given its reception. Some commentators suggest that Aristotle's discussion of transparency is of antiquarian interest only. Others have expressed incredulity at the way Aristotle's account conflicts with the manifest facts of experience. While leaving open the possibility of errors and omissions, we should try to understand Aristotle's account by attending to the phenomena as we understand it to be and by asking how that phenomena might have appeared as Aristotle describes it. As a methodology, this is little more than the minimum exercise of charity. However, it is worth stating explicitly if only because it is routinely flouted. Adhering to this precept yields and understanding of transparency that is sensible, phenomenologically adequate, and a reasonable approximation of the truth. It is also a philosophically revealing exercise since to interpret Aristotle's text in this way is to attend to the phenomena under investigation.

\subsection{Transparency in \emph{De Anima}} % (fold)
\label{sub:transparency_in_}

Aristotle defines the transparent as that which is visible, though not visible in itself, but owing its visibility to the color of another thing (\emph{De Anima} \textsc{ii}.7 418\( ^{b} \) 4--6). 

First, one might be surprised that Aristotle defines transparency in terms the manner of its visibility, or the way in which it appears in perceptual experience. Isn't it more natural to think of transparency in terms of that through which remote objects appear---that is to say, not in terms of the manner of its visibility, but in terms of its being a condition on the visibility of other things? We will return to this issue.

The second thing to remark about Aristotle's definition is the nature of the intended contrast between something being visible in itself and something owing it's visibility to another thing. Aristotle does not have in mind here what he elsewhere calls incidental perception (\emph{De Anima} \textsc{ii}.6 418\( ^{a} \) 20--23). Seeing the transparent medium by seeing colors arrayed in it is not like seeing the son of Diares by seeing a white speck. Being the son of Diares is not sensible the way being transparent is (cf. \emph{De Anima} \textsc{ii}.6 418\( ^{a} \) 23--26).

Third, once we recover from our initial surprise at Aristotle defining transparency in terms of the manner of its visibility, and we consider the plausibility of that claim, quite apart from its status as a definition, we discover a potential insight. I, at least, have the corresponding intuition about illumination. I believe we see the character of the illumination by seeing the way objects are illuminated.The former is a state of the external medium whereas the latter is a property of a particular arrayed in that medium (though, of course, a property that the particular could only have given the state of the medium). So when viewing a brightly lit pantry, one sees the the brightness of the pantry by seeing the brightly lit objects arranged in it.  Hilbert makes a similar phenomenological observation:
\begin{quote}
	Do we see how an object is illuminated or do we see the illumination itself? On phenomenological grounds the first option seems better to me. What we see as changing with the illumination is an aspect of the object itself, not the light source or the space surrounding the object. \citep[150--151]{Hilbert:2007qy}
\end{quote}

Transparency is a nature or power common to different substances. It is shared by liquids, like air and water, and certain solids and is incidental to the nature of each. A medium is actually transparent not due to its nature but due rather to the contingent presence of the fiery substance. The continual presence of the fiery substance is required for the transparency of the medium to persist. Suppose I light a fuse with a cigar. Prudence councils that I should remove myself from the scene. Should I be enjoying the cigar I might take it with me. But while the fuse would remain lit even when the cigar is removed, the air would not remain transparent when the fiery substance is removed. When the fiery substance is removed, darkness supervenes. Not only does the persistence of transparency depend upon the continual presence of the fiery substance, but, arguably at least, it depends as well on its continual activity. This may be taken to be implied by his claim that light is the activity of the actual transparent (\emph{De Anima} \textsc{ii}.7 418\( ^{b} \) 9--10).

Light is a state that the medium is in when it is actually transparent. Aristotle denies that light is fire, or a body, or an emanation (\emph{De Anima} \textsc{ii}.7 418\( ^{b} \) 13--18). He denies as well that light moves, otherwise its motion would be visible as it travels from East to West (\emph{De Anima} \textsc{ii}.7 418\( ^{b} \) 21-27). These claims are puzzling if by ``photos'' Aristotle means, at least approximately, what we mean by ``light''. But why assume that? Begin by focusing on Aristotle's claim that light is a \emph{state} that a medium is in when it is actually transparent. State is really the wrong category for light as we presently understand it to be. But now, in line with our avowed methodology, let's ask whether there could be a state that we can recognize on our present understanding that could reasonably be what Aristotle had in mind when he speaks of \emph{photos}? With the question so framed the resolution of our difficulties should be obvious. What state is a medium in when it is actually transparent, and where the persistence of this state depends on the continual presence and activity of a fiery substance? When it is illuminated, of course. By ``photos'' Aristotle means a state of illumination. And that a medium when it is actually transparent is in a state of illumination sustained by the presence and activity of a fiery substance strikes me as a not unreasonable approximation of the truth. Moreover, it coheres well with the phenomenology of illumination. Consider what must have been the familiar experience of lighting an oil lamp to illuminate a room.

There remain anachronistic elements in Aristotle's account. Consider his empirical argument that light does not move (\emph{De Anima} \textsc{ii}.7 418\( ^{b} \) 21-27). If light is a state of a medium sustained by the presence and activity of a fiery substance, then this claim has the consequence that the fiery substance cannot propagate through a potentially transparent medium. For as the fiery substance propagated through the medium, the illuminated region of that medium would change over time. It would be consistent with Aristotle's claim that light does not move that the fiery substance instantaneously propagates through a potentially transparent medium, but that would be a Pickwickian sense of propagation. Propagation is a \emph{process} that unfolds through time and so could not, strictly speaking, be instantaneous.

\subsection{Transparency in \emph{De Sensu}} % (fold)
\label{sub:transparency_in_}

In \emph{De Anima}, Aristotle defines the transparent in terms of the manner of its visibility. It is visible, though not visible in itself, but owing its visibility to the color of another thing. I have remarked that it might seem more natural to characterize transparency, not in terms of the manner of its visibility, but in terms of its being that through which remote objects appear---as a condition on the visibility of other things. However, this latter conception is not entirely absent in Aristotle. It is at least implicit in the corresponding discussion of color and transparency in \emph{De Sensu}.

In \emph{De Sensu} Aristotle sets out to explain what each of the sense objects ``must be to produce the sensation in full actuality'' (\emph{De Sensu}, 3 439\( ^{a} \) 10). This is a further inquiry, not directly addressed by \emph{De Anima}. Unsurprisingly, then, there are novel elements to the \emph{De Sensu} discussion. Thus, novel claims that emerge include, for example, that color resides in the proportion of transparent that exists in all bodies, and an account of the generation of the hues in terms of the ratio of black and white in a mixture. Given these novel elements, the question arises whether \emph{De Sensu} represents an extension of the doctrines of \emph{De Anima}, or a change of mind. While there is some evidence that Aristotle has not completely harmonized new ideas with old, I believe that Aristotle meant to be offering an extension of the \emph{De Anima} account, and not a substantive revision. Or at any rate, this will be my working hypothesis.

One novel element is the characterization of color as ``the limit of the transparent in a determinately bounded body'' (\emph{De Sensu}, 3, 439\( ^{b} \) 11). This prompted the Renaissance commentator Jacopo Zabarella to complain that Aristotle has defined color twice over. However, there is no evidence in the text that Aristotle regarded this claim as a definition. Rather, it appears as the conclusion of an argument. In that argument, Aristotle explains that color inheres not only in unbounded things, such as air and water, but in bounded things as well. What's the distinction between the bounded and the unbounded? The examples of the transparent are restricted in \emph{De Sensu} to air and water. Broackes suggests, naturally enough, that that the distinction is between liquids, like air and water, and solid objects. To describe liquids as unbounded is to highlight their lack of fixed boundaries. However, I doubt that is what Aristotle had in mind. In \emph{De Anima}, Aristotle claims that not only are liquids such as air and water transparent, but so are certain solid objects. He does not himself give examples of transparent solids, but a glass bead would do. And the problem is that any such example would possess fixed boundaries and yet would remain transparent. 

What could the unbounded be if it is not simply the lack of fixed boundaries? I believe that good sense can be made of Aristotle's distinction if we understand it in perceptual terms. Nontransparent bodies, such as opaque solids, are perceptually impenetrable. Unlike transparent bodies you can't see in them or through them. Their surface is the site of visual resistance; perceptual impenetrability defines a visual boundary through which nothing further can appear. Transparent bodies, in contrast, are perceptually penetrable. One can see in them and through them. The particulars arrayed in a transparent medium appear through that medium. The transparent is unbounded since it offers insufficient visual resistance to define a perceptually impenetrable boundary.

Which is not, of course, to say that the transparent can offer no visual resistance. In \emph{De Sensu}, Aristotle emphasizes that transparency comes in \emph{degrees}. When Aristotle speaks of color as the limit of the transparent in bounded bodies, he has in mind surface color. But he also speaks of the color of the transparent medium:
\begin{quote}
    Air and water obviously have color; for their brightness is of the nature of color. But in their case because the color resides in something unbounded, air and sea do not show the same color near at hand and to those who approach them as they have at a distance. (\emph{De Sensu} 3 439\( ^{b} \)1--3)
\end{quote}
Air and water, when transparent, are bright. And brightness, Aristotle claims, is of the nature of color. The attribution of brightness, however, is consistent with attributing no particular hue to the medium. If the medium is perfectly transparent, then the only visible hues will be the colors of bounded particulars arrayed in that medium. But the next line contains the suggestion that imperfectly transparent media, while remaining perceptually penetrable to some degree, may themselves have a particular hue---not a surface color but a \emph{volume} color. From a cliff overhanging the sea, the sea may appear a clear blue. But, if enticed by the sea, one descended to the beach and examined a handful of sea water, it is not blue at all, but transparent. Similarly, looking up at the sky on a clear autumn afternoon, one sees an expanse of blue. But if one were to travel to that region of the sky, by helicopter,say, nothing blue would be found. The implicit thought is that the visual resistance of an imperfectly transparent medium increases with an increase in volume. The further one sees into a transparent medium, the more resistance that medium offers to sight. And volume color is the effect of this resistance.

The color of an imperfectly transparent medium does not occlude the colors of bounded particulars arrayed in it or seen through it. But the color of the transparent medium may affect the color appearance of objects seen through it. Thus the sun, which in itself appears white, takes on a crimson hue when seen through a fog or cloud of smoke (\emph{De Sensu} 3 440\( ^{a} \)10--11). This might be what Aristotle has in mind when he claims that bounded particulars have a fixed color unless affected by atmospheric conditions (\emph{De Sensu} 3 439\( ^{b} \)5--7).

We thus have a continuum from the perfectly transparent on one end to the colored and opaque on the other. Points on the continuum differ with respect to their degree of perceptual penetrability culminating in the perceptual impenetrable. We can envision the transition from perfect transparency in the following terms. Consider a tank of clear water into which is poured a blue dye. Suppose the absorption rate of the dye is too quick to be visible. So we do not see clouds of blue dye propagating through the clear liquid. Rather we see the volume taking on the blue and become increasingly opaque. At the end of this transition, the tank is surface blue---no thing can appear in it or through it. Color, that is surface color, is in this sense the limit of the transparent.








That argument crucially involves the convergence of two conceptually distinct notions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the limit of a body
    \item the limit of transparent
\end{enumerate}
