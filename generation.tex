\section{Light and Dark} % (fold)
\label{sec:introduction}
The presence of the fiery substance illuminates the potentially transparent me\-di\-um. White (\emph{leukon}) corresponds to the presence of this determinant of what is actually transparent. Conversely, black (\emph{melaton}) corresponds to its absence. The absence of the fiery substance darkens the potentially transparent medium. White and black are thus associated with a fundamental condition on the visibility of remote external particulars. No doubt in part because of this Aristotle attempts to explain the other hues in terms of the ratio of white and black. He considers three such accounts, in terms of (1) juxtaposition, (2) overlap, and (3) mixture, advocating the third. On all three accounts chromatic hues are determined by white and black in various ratios, the accounts differing only in how these ratios are implemented. 

The fundamental idea common to all three accounts can seem surprising. How can the ratio of white and black result in something appearing red? Would it not instead appear gray? Thus \citet[210]{Hett:1936fk} writes that Aristotle's ``doctrine could hardly have survived a few experiments with pigments''. If Aristotle's account were disconfirmable by elementary experiments with pigment mixtures, then why did he not investigate the matter? Was it merely to avoid Plato's charge of impiety?
\begin{quote}
    There will be no difficulty in seeing how and by what mixtures the colors derived from these are made according to the rules of probability. He, however, who should attempt to verify all this by experiment would forget the difference between human and divine nature. For God only has the knowledge and also the power which are able to combine many things into one and again resolve the one into many. But no man either is or ever will be able to accomplish either the one or the other operation. (Plato, \emph{Timaeus} 68d)
\end{quote}
Aristotle's account of the generation of the hues may be surprising, but it would be wrong to prematurely dismiss it. 

The first thing to observe is that \emph{leukon} and \emph{melaton} are better understood as light and dark, rather than white and black. There is a general tendency in Greek color vocabulary to classify colors in terms of relative brightness rather than hue \citep[see][]{Gladstone:1858fk,Platnauer:1921bh,Osbourne:1968vn,Lloyd:2007fk}. Traces of such a usage exist in English. Thus we speak of white wine and white people, though neither are white in hue. Similarly neither black people nor black grapes are black in hue. This usage in English, however, does not seem to be perfectly general but is rather lexically determined. It is not the case that for any noun \( N \), the occurrence of ``white'' in \( \ulcorner [white_{Adj}][N_{N}] \urcorner \) can be interpreted in terms of relative brightness instead of hue. The availability of such an interpretation seems to be limited to the adjective's application to certain nouns. The more general usage in Greek is philosophically significant, for it transforms Aristotle's claim. Aristotle is not claiming that the hues are determined by the ratio of white and black, but that they are determined by the ratio of light and dark. Experiments with pigment mixtures are irrelevant to the truth of this latter claim. Thus, Aristotle need not have risked Plato's charge of impiety as Hett recomends. Not only is the thought that the hues are determined by the ratio of light and dark not disconfirmable by impious experimentation, it is independently plausible. Indeed, as I will argue below, it is an ancient prefiguration of modern reflectance theories \citep[see][]{Hilbert:1987jq}.

Two further considerations are relevant. First, there are a range of observable phenomena that support Aristotle's fundamental claim that a ratio of white and black or light and dark can give rise to chromatic appearances. Importantly, Aristotle himself provides an example. Second, Aristotle's account has ancient precedent. Thus when Theophrastus discusses Democritus's view that there are four primary colors (understood as simple colors in terms of which all other colors are to be explained), he contrasts it with the then dominant view that white and black are the two primary colors:
\begin{quote}
    But first of all, his increase of the number of primaries presents a difficulty; for the other investigators propose white and black as the only simple colours. (\emph{De Sensibus} 79; DK 68\textsc{a}135; \citealt{Stratton:1917vn})
\end{quote}
It is reasonable to suppose that Aristotle's account of the generation of the hues draws on this pre-Democritean tradition. Before discussing Aristotle's account of the generation of the hues, then, I will review some empirical support for its central idea, and will discuss the precedent for this doctrine in Parmenides and Empedocles.

\section{Empirical Support} % (fold)
\label{sec:empirical_support}
In 1894, an English toy maker, Charles Benham, devised a top adorned with a black and white pattern (see Figure~\ref{fig:2}). Sold through Messrs. Newton and Co., an announcement of the ``Artificial Spectrum Top'' was published in \emph{Nature}:
	\begin{quote}
		The top consists of a disc, one half of which is black, while the other half has twelve arcs of concentric circles drawn upon it. Each arc subtends an angle of forty-five degrees. In the first quadrant there are three such concentric arcs, in the next three more, and so on; the only difference being that the arcs are parts of circles of which the radii increase in arithmetical progression. Each quadrant thus contains a group of arcs differing in length from those of the other quadrants. The curious point is that when this disc is revolved, the impression of concentric circles of different colors is produced upon the retina. If the direction of rotation is reversed, the order of these tints is also reversed. \citep{Benham:1894kx}
	\end{quote}
Specifically, if rotated clockwise, the innermost arcs form reddish rings, the next greenish rings, the next light blue rings, and the outermost arcs form violet rings. If rotated counterclockwise, the pattern is reversed with the innermost arcs now forming violet rings and the outermost reddish rings. The apparent colors of Benham's spinning disk are the ``subjective colors'' first described by \citep{Fechner:1838vn} and, hence, are also sometimes described as ``Fechner-Benham colors''.

\end{figure}

Consider a puzzling aspect of the subjective colors of the Benham disk. Each of the spinning arcs reflect light with the same spectral content and with equal average luminance. In advance of observing the spinning disk, one might reasonably expect the spinning arcs to appear as gray rings of equal brightness. Why, then, do the rings appear reddish, greenish, light blue, and violet? The subjective colors of the Benham disk are not completely understood \citep[for a review of some of the color science see][]{Campenhausen:1995yq}. However, this much is clear: The innermost ring appearing reddish is the result of the visual system integrating temporal inhomogeneities presented by the spinning disk. Presentations of black and white stimuli altering at a particular temporal ratio elicits a chromatic response in normal human perceivers. 

This basic principle was used in a prototype color television broadcasting system \citep[]{Butterfield:1968uq,Butterfield:1970kx}. Developed by James F. Butterfield (who studied philosophy at the University of Chicago as an undergraduate), the broadcasting system consists of the Butterfield color encoder that produces a monochromatic signal that when broadcast and displayed on a black-and-white monitor presents a chromatic appearance. The Butterfield encoder extracts a monochromatic signal from the colored scene by passing the light from the scene through cyan, magenta, and yellow filters. The filters themselves are arranged in, what is in effect, a modified Benham Disk (see Figure~\ref{fig:3}). The bottom half of the filter is opaque with the colored filters fanned across the top half. The filters thus form a disk which is rotated. A colored object will appear black when seen through a filter of a complementary color. This and the opaque half of the rotating disk produces a pulsed black-and-white signal that elicits a chromatic response in normal human perceivers. The system produced good skin tones but unmixed hues, especially red, tended to flicker. The initial public demonstration was, by all accounts, startling:
\begin{quote}
    When electronic color was first publicly demonstrated in the Los Angeles area over KNXT, no prior announcement had been made at the request of a soft-drink manufacturer sponsoring the test. The beverage firm wanted its color commercials to be a complete surprise to viewers of black-and-white receivers. And, the telecasts were that, to say the very least. Within hours of the electronic-color broadcast, thousands of viewers began asking the same question, ``What happened? Did I really see color on my black-and-white receiver? Or am I having hallucinations?'' \citep[]{Griffin:1968fk}
\end{quote}
The power to demand such attention did not go unnoticed. The final public demonstration was an Eva Perón political advertisement.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=.55]{graphics/color_encoder.jpg}
    \caption{Butterfield color encoder \citep{Shatavsky:1968vn}}
    \label{fig:3}
\end{figure}

That the pulsed black-and-white signal produced by the Butterfield color encoder gives rise to a chromatic appearance is once again the result of the visual system integrating temporal inhomogeneities. However, these temporal inhomogeneities are not the result of spatial movement of the object of perception, but rather due to the qualitative alterations over time of a stationary object. Each involves the presentation of white and black stimuli altering at a particular temporal ratio eliciting a chromatic response in normal human perceivers. They differ in how that temporal ratio is implemented---by the motion of an object whose parts qualitatively differ or by the qualitative alteration over time of a stationary object. 

Stated so abstractly it is easy to see that there is a third possibility. If the temporal ratio that determines a given chromatic appearance can be implemented by the motion of a black and white object, the perceivers motion relative to a black and white object should do so as well. And indeed it can. Our eyes constantly scan the scene with involuntary saccades. Scanning a stationary black and white object can give rise to chromatic appearance \citep[72]{Hardin:1993kn}. Thus Sorabji claims that certain Bridget Riley paintings are an example:
\begin{quote}
    The English painter, Bridget Riley, has produced pictures in which black and white are juxtaposed, in long ribbons \ldots\ When people look at these black and white ribbons, many are able to see all sorts of colours appearing. \citep[295]{Sorabji:2022qf}
\end{quote}
These chromatic appearances are the result of the visual system integrating temporal inhomogeneities that result from the eye involuntarily moving across a stationary black and white object.

These examples involve artifacts and technology unavailable at Aristotle's time. And while they may make plausible for \emph{us} that ratios of white and black or light and dark can, sometimes at least, give rise to chromatic appearances, they could not have done so for Aristotle. What empirical observation available to Aristotle could have made vivid for him the possibility that chromatic appearances are the result of the ratio of light and dark in the perceived scene? An example discussed in the last chapter could give rise to the relevant experience. The sun is white, but it appears red when seen through fog or a cloud of smoke (\emph{De Sensu} 3 440\( ^{a} \)10--11).  The white sun, when superimposed by black particles suspended in the intervening transparent medium, looks red. The reduction of the sun's brilliance by the intervening particulate matter of the smoke results in the sun's crimson appearance. What is presently important is a general feature of Aristotle's example: that a reduction of the sun's brilliance results in a chromatic appearance. That provides direct partial support for the more general claim that a proportion of light and dark can give rise to a chromatic appearance. In this regard, the point of Aristotle's example in its context, that the red appearing proportion of light and dark is the result of overlap or sumperimposition, is of less importance.

\section{Parmenides} % (fold)
\label{sec:parmenides}
Theophrastus (\emph{De Sensibus} 79; DK 68\textsc{a}135) alludes to a pre-Democritean tradition according to which white and black are the primary colors, the colors in terms of which all other colors are to be explained. While Theophrastus does not name any particular thinker belonging to this tradition, one may reasonably speculate. In his notorious study, among the five ``signs of the immaturity'' of the Homeric color scheme, Gladstone cites the following:  
\begin{quote}
    The vast predominance of the most crude and elemental forms of colour, black and white, over every other, and the decided tendency to treat other colours as simply intermediate modes between these two extremes. \citep[458]{Gladstone:1858fk}
\end{quote}
One can reasonably accept Gladstone's observation about the structure of the Ho\-meric color scheme, while bracketing any conclusions about relative deficiencies in the Greek's capacity to discriminate color. If we do, then arguably the pre-De\-mo\-cri\-tean tradition that Theophrastus alludes to has Homeric roots. Let us selectively examine this ancient tradition by attending to two key figures familiar to Aristotle, Parmenides and Empedocles (though the inclusion of the latter is controversial).

In the prologue to his poem, the goddess promises to reveal to Parmenides two things, the Way of Truth and the Way of Mortal Opinion. The doctrines of the latter she assures him are false; nevertheless, Parmenides must learn these too (DK 28\textsc{b}1 31). The Way of Mortal Opinion is an account of the world ``as it appears'' (DK 28\textsc{b}8 60; \citealt[155]{McKirahan:1994ve}), and the goddess presents it to Parmenides ``so that no mortal opinion may ever overtake'' him (DK 28\textsc{b}8 61; \citealt[155]{McKirahan:1994ve}). The Way of Mortal Opinion is a cosmology in the Milesian tradition, though Parmenides is not expounding the views of any particular Milesian cosmologist \citep[on Parmenides and Milesian cosmology see][]{Kahn:1994qf}. Rather, he is presenting what is, by his lights, the best account that can be given along those lines. Traditional Milesian cosmologies tend to be monistic, but the Way of Mortal Opinion posits two fundamental and irreducible principles that stand in opposition, Fire and Night or light and dark (DK 28\textsc{b}8 53--61, 28\textsc{b}9). The thought seems to be this. Having shown, in the Way of Truth, that monism is inconsistent with appearances, the Way of Mortal Opinion must posit a plurality of principles in opposition, if it is to accommodate the plurality and opposition encountered in the world as it appears in sensory experience:
\begin{verse}
    For they made up their minds to name two forms,\\ 
    Of which it is not right to name one---in this they have gone astray---\\
    And they distinguished things opposite in body, and established signs\\
    Apart from one another---for one, the aetherial fire of flame,\\
    Mild, very light, the same as itself in every direction,\\
    But not the same as the other; but that other one, in itself\\
    Is opposite---dark night, a dense and heavy body.\\
    I declare to you all the ordering as it appears,\\
    So that no mortal opinion may ever overtake you.
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}
    But since all things have been named light and night\\
    And the things which accord with their powers have been assigned to these things and those,\\
    All is full of light and obscuring night together,\\
    of both equally, since neither has no share.\\
    (Parmenides, DK 28\textsc{b}8 53--9 4; \citealt[155]{McKirahan:1994ve})
\end{verse}
The two principles, Fire and Night, of the Way of Mortal Opinion, have attributes called ``signs''. Like Fire and Night themselves, the attributes of these principles stand in opposition. Fire is bright, Night is dark; Fire is lightweight, Night is heavy, and so on. Fire and Night may have further attributes not listed here; much of the Way of Mortal Opinion is missing. A sense of its ambition and importance, however, is provided by Plutarch:
\begin{quote}
    But Parmenides \ldots\ has actually made a cosmic order, and by blending as elements the light and the dark produces out of them and by their operation the whole world of sense. Thus he has much to say about earth, heaven, sun, moon, and stars, and has recounted the genesis of man; and for an ancient natural philosopher---who has put together a book of his own, and is not pulling apart the book of another---he has left nothing of real importance unsaid. (Plutarch, \emph{Adversus Colotem} 1114 b--c; \citealt[231]{Einarson:1967zr})
\end{quote}
The attributes of the fundamental principles of the Way of Mortal Opinion are sensible qualities arrayed in opposing pairs of contraries. In contrast, the attributes of the one being of the Way of Truth are not sensible (\emph{aistheton}) but intelligible (\emph{noeton}) properties (such as form or unity). 

Arguably, the cosmology of Fire and Night posited by the Way of Mortal Opinion is prefigured in the prologue of the poem. On his journey to meet the goddess, Parmenides, escorted by the daughters of the Sun, travels from Night to Day:
\begin{verse}
    \ldots\ the daughters of the Sun\\
    Were hastening to escort <me> after leaving the house of Night\\
    For the light, having pushed back the veils from their heads with their hands.\\ 
    (Parmenides, DK 28\textsc{b}1 8--10; \citealt[151]{McKirahan:1994ve})
\end{verse}
But before they can meet the goddess they must pass through the gates of the roads of Night and Day:
\begin{verse}
    There are the gates of the roads of Night and Day,\\
    And a lintel and a stone threshold contains them.\\ 
    High in the sky they are filled by huge doors\\
    Of which avenging Justice holds the keys that fit them.\\
    (Parmenides, DK 28\textsc{b}1 11--13; \citealt[151]{McKirahan:1994ve})
\end{verse}
Parmenides must leave the sensible world governed by alternations of Night and Day, to the intelligible world where a goddess awaits to reveal to him the Way of Truth.

If, according to the Way of Mortal Opinion, the entirety of sensible world---in which appear ``earth, heaven, sun, moon, and stars''---is ultimately explained in terms of light and dark in opposition, then the qualities of material objects that appear in sensory experience are themselves to be explained in these terms. Since colors are qualities of material objects that appear in sensory experience, they are themselves to be explained in terms of the ``blending'' of light and dark. Whether or not Theophrastus had Parmenides in mind, Parmenides straightforwardly belongs to the pre-Democritean tradition that postulates white and black or light and dark as the primary colors.

\section{Empedocles} % (fold)
\label{sec:empedocles}

It is at least arguable that Theophrastus did in fact have Empedocles in mind when alluding to this pre-Democritean tradition. Despite extensive discussion of Empedocles' views about sensory experience and its objects, Theophrastus does not make the parallel charge against Empedocles that he makes against Democritus (\emph{De Sensibus} 79; DK 68\textsc{a}135; \citealt{Stratton:1917vn}). Moreover, as we have seen, Theophrastus complains that while Empedocles has explained the perception of white and black he has failed to explain the perception of the other hues (\emph{De Sensibus} 17; \citealt{Stratton:1917vn}). This is strong defeasible evidence that Theophrastus took Empedocles to be among the thinkers who take white and black or light and dark as the primary colors (albeit with limited success, at least by Theophrastus' lights).

In contrast with Parmenidean monism, Empedocles postulates the existence of four ``roots'' or elements---water, earth, air, and fire---and two principles---\-Love and Strife. Whereas Love, the principle of harmony, has the power to unite, Strife, the principle of disorder, has the power to divide. According to Empedocles, things are colored because of the combination of the elements:
\begin{verse}
    And if, concerning these things, your conviction is in any way wanting,\\
    as to how from the blending of water and earth and aither and sun\\
    the forms and colours of mortals came to be,\\
    which have now come to be, fitted together by Aphrodite.
    (DK \textsc{b}71; \citealt[74 249]{Inwood:2001ve})
\end{verse}
The forms and colors of objects we encounter in sensory experience are to be explained in terms of the combination of the elements that result from Love's influence counteracting the operation of Strife.

\citet[222]{Wright:1981zr} suggests that the reference to form and color is a deliberate echo of an earlier fragment:
\begin{verse}
    As when painters adorn votive offerings,\\
    men well-learned in their craft because of cunning,\\
    and so when they take in their hands many-coloured pigments,\\
    mixing them in harmony, some more, others less,\\
    from them they prepare forms resembling all things,
    making trees and men and women\\
    and beasts and birds and water-nourished fish\\
    and long-lived gods, first in their prerogatives.\\
    In this way let not deception overcome your thought organ\\
    that the source of mortal things, as many as have become obvious---countless---is anything else,\\
    but know these things clearly, having heard the story from a god.\\ 
    (DK \textsc{b}23; \citealt[27 231]{Inwood:2001ve})
\end{verse}
However, the two fragments seem to be making different points. Empedocles in this earlier fragment describes the generation of the objects we encounter in the sensible world by analogy with painting. Just as painters can represent everything in the sensible world by combining pigments in various proportions, Love and Strife can generate everything in the sensible world by combining the elements in various proportions. However, unlike the later fragment (DK \textsc{b}71) no specific mention is made about the colors of the generated objects or how they are the result of the combination of elements. Whereas the earlier fragment (DK \textsc{b}23) claims that a combination of a few colors suffice to represent the forms and colors encountered in the sensible world, the latter fragment (DK \textsc{b}71) claims that a combination a few elements suffice for the forms and colors encountered in the sensible world.

The painting analogy remains instructive, however. Specifically, it sheds light on the sense in which the combination of a few colors suffice to represent all the colors that appear in sensory experience. This is important since in the context of Empedocles' analogy, this is the sense in which the elements combine. And given the latter fragment (DK \textsc{b}71), the elements when combined in this sense suffice for the form and color of all things. First, observe that, despite their manifest plurality, the ``roots'' or elements are otherwise Parmenidean beings. Change is the result of different combinations of these unchanging elements:
\begin{verse}
    I shall tell you something else. There is no growth of any or all mortal things\\
    nor any end in destructive death,\\
    but only mixture and interchange of what is mixed\\
    exist, and growth is the name given to them by men.\\
    (DK \textsc{b}8; \citealt[21 221]{Inwood:2001ve})
\end{verse}
So for the analogy to hold, the painter's combination cannot be understood as a blending or mixture (on the model of mixing oil paint on a palette, or dissolving sugar in water). If when the elements combine they do so in a mixture, then the elements would no longer be distinguishable in the compound. But this is inconsistent with their status as Parmenidean beings. So a negative lesson, then, is that the combination as it figures in the analogy cannot coherently be understood as blending or mixture.

If combination, here, cannot coherently be understood as blending or mixture, how, then, is it to be understood? Recent commentators have made the important suggestion that combination as it figures in the analogy should be understood in terms of the actual practices of fifth century \textsc{bc} painting \citep{Wright:1981zr,Mourelatos:1987fk,Ierodiakonou:2005fk}. However, this yields two distinct models, and as a consequence, I am less certain about the positive lessons that the analogy affords us.

Consider what is arguably the most important development of fifth century \textsc{bc} painting, the development of chiaroscuro or \emph{skiagraphia} \citep[see][]{Bruno:1977fk,Keuls:1975uq,Pemberton:1976kx}. In archaic Greek painting, figures appear outlined and uniformly colored in a two-dimensional pictorial plane. Moreover, the color of the figures tended to complement and support the overall two-dimensional composition. However, in the fifth century \textsc{bc}, the ``shadow painters'' came to emphasize, instead, lightness and darkness in organizing their compositions. There was less reliance on outlining, figures were no longer uniformly colored as primitive methods of shading were developed, and as a result, the figures began to emerge from the two-dimensional pictorial plane. To emphasize the importance of relative brightness in their composition, the shadow painters worked with a limited palette. Nevertheless, they were able to produce the appearance of a variety of colors by combining the colors of this limited palette. Importantly, there were two techniques for combining the few colors, corresponding to different periods in the development of \emph{skiagraphia}.

In \emph{De Gloria Atheniensium}, Plutarch attributes the invention of fifth century \textsc{bc} chiaroscuro to Apollodorus. In seeming contradiction to Plutarch's testimony, Quintillian claims that a student of Apollodorus, Zeuxis, invented \emph{luminum ubrarumqu rationem}---the law of light and shadow. \citet[27--29]{Bruno:1977fk} reconciles these apparently conflicting claims by arguing that they are in fact describing distinct dramatic episodes or turning points in the development of fifth century \textsc{bc} chiaroscuro:
\begin{quote}
    The Apollodorian accomplishment and that artist's importance in the art-historical record as it has come down to us from ancient times can only be explained if he was somehow able to synthesize earlier, less successful attempts, so that a systematic relationship between chiaroscuro and color was established in some consistent manner. Such an accomplishment and nothing less (when we consider the rather late fifth-century dates we must assume for the career of this artist) might have struck the imagination of the ancient viewer as anything so dramatic as an ``invention''. Then Zeuxis, who ``walked through the doors'' that his teacher, Apollodorus, had opened, must have been able to develop more sophisticated variations of the earlier methods. In his own mature work, he must have departed in some striking manner from the system of shading that had characterized his master's pictures; the likelihood is that Zeuxis invented a kind of chiaroscuro in which the relationship of color to dark and light was definitely altered, in which shading assumed a more dominant role and the nuances of coloring and brushwork became more and more complex, perhaps more ``painterly''. \citep[29]{Bruno:1977fk}
\end{quote}

In \emph{De Gloria Atheniensium}, not only does Plutarch attribute the invention of \emph{skiagraphia} to Apollodorus, but also the mixing of colors. Specifically, working with a limited palette, Apollodorus would produce novel colors by overlaying washes of different colors. A four-color palette was common in the fifth century \textsc{bc} and  Pliny reports that it reached its finest expression in fourth century \textsc{bc} painting:
\begin{quote}
	Four colours only---white from Melos, Attic yellow, red from Sinope on the Black Sea, and the black called ``atramentum''---were used by Apelles, Aetion, Melanthios and Nikomachos in their immortal works. (\emph{Historia Naturalis} 35 50; \citealt[97]{Jex-Blake:1896uq})
\end{quote}
The Alexander mosaic depicting the Battle of Isis is a Roman work from the first century \textsc{bc} that is a copy of a Greek four-color painting. Pliny (\emph{Historia Naturalis} 35 110; \citealt[143]{Jex-Blake:1896uq}) attributes the original four-color painting to Philoxenos of Eretria ``who painted for king Kassander the battle between Alexander and Dareios, a picture second to none.'' The Alexander mosaic gives us a sense of the naturalistic skin tones that could be achieved with four-color painting. However, being a mosaic, it is in this respect misleading---the fundamental method of color combination in mosaics is the juxtaposition of differently colored tiles as opposed to the overlaying of differently colored washes (though of course these methods can be combined). Sellers suggests that for a better sense of what can be accomplished with only four colors we need only consider Titian's ``Christ crowned with thorns'' in the Louvre \citep[97 note]{Jex-Blake:1896uq}. So one way of combining colors is by overlaying differently colored washes, that is, by overlap.

We have seen \citet[29]{Bruno:1977fk} claim that in the sophisticated chiaroscuro inaugurated by Zeuxis ``shading assumed a more dominant role and the nuances of coloring and brushwork became more and more complex, perhaps more `painterly'.'' A sense of this more ``painterly'' style can be seen, according to Bruno, in the figure of Rhadmanthys painted on the facade of the tomb of Lefkadia:
\begin{quote}
    A dark is not just an area of darker pink or brown flesh tones; it has blues and greens running through it and a complex system of overlapping tones in which every individual stroke is a slightly different color. Color accidents, produced by quick, overlapping brushstrokes, abound throughout the work and are accidents upon which the artist relied. \citep[25]{Bruno:1977fk}
\end{quote}
In the late development of fifth century \textsc{bc} chiaroscuro, as light and dark come to further dominate the compositional scheme, the relationship between form and color became complicated. Whereas earlier forms of chiaroscuro would use one color for shaded parts of a figure, later forms would use a variety of colors, their choice controlled more by relative brightness than hue. The effect of this more complicated scheme may without too much risk of anachronism be described as proto-impressionistic. However, \emph{pace} \citet{Keuls:1975uq}, I do not think that the literary and archeological evidence supports the attribution of nineteenth century ``divisionist'' technique to fifth century \textsc{bc} painters \citep[see][]{Pemberton:1976kx}. However, there need be no ancient predecessor of Suerat in fifth century \textsc{bc} painting for there to be a method of color combination that involved not the overlap but the juxtaposition of color.

We have seen that combination in Empedocles' painting analogy cannot be understood in terms of mixture. If the sense in which painters combine colors in various proportions to represent the forms of all things is analogous to the sense in which the opposing forces of Love and Strife combine the elements in various proportions, then the metaphysical status of the elements rules out understanding the combination as mixture, since the elements would be indistinguishable in the compound. Fifth century \textsc{bc} painting, however, provides us with two further models. Perhaps the combination could be understood, not in terms of mixture, but in terms of overlap or juxtaposition. 

In \emph{On Generation and Corruption}, Aristotle claims that the Empedoclean elements combine by means of juxtaposition and compares the compound to a brick structure:
\begin{quote}
    For how is the manner of their coming-to-be to be conceived by those who maintain a theory like Empedocles? They must conceive it as \emph{composition}---just as a wall comes-to-be out of bricks and stones: and the `Mixture', of which they speak, will be composed out of the `elements', these being preserved in it unaltered but with their small particles juxtaposed. (\emph{On Generation and Corruption}, \textsc{ii} 7 334\( ^{a} \)26--30)
\end{quote}
The Aristotelian interpretation is supported by Galen's testimony:
\begin{quote}
     For Empedocles says that we, and all the other earthly bodies, are generated from the same elements assumed by Hippocrates, and these elements are not combined with each other, but, as small pieces, stand next to each other, touching. (\emph{Hippocratis De Naturis Homina Commentaria} 15 49; DK 31\textsc{a}43)
\end{quote}
And Galen compares the combination of Empedoclean elements to a powder consisting of finely ground metals (\emph{Hippocratis De Naturis Homina Commentaria} 15 32; DK 31\textsc{a}34). Further support for the Aristotelian interpretation comes from an Empedoclean metaphor. Thus he speaks of Love's influence in combining the elements as ``the divine glue of harmony'' (DK \textsc{b}96; \citealt[62 245]{Inwood:2001ve}). The metaphor of gluing suggests that the elements ``are not combined with each other, but, as small pieces, stand next to each other, touching''.

If we accept the Aristotelian interpretation, then the combination of the elements should be understood on the model of juxtaposition. So, for the analogy to hold, the painter's method of combining colors must itself be understood on the model of juxtaposition, a method arguably associated with the late chiaroscuro inaugurated by Zeuxis and whose influence can be seen in the tomb of Lefkadia. However, Zeuxis' achievement is too late---it arguably post-dates the composition of Empedocles poem(s).  \citet[38--39]{Wright:1981zr}, following \citet[148]{Guthrie:1965ys}, associates the painter's combining of colors wiith Apollodorus and Greek four-color painting. Wright proposes to understand the painter's combining the colors in various proportions with the technique of color combination associated with Greek four-color painting, but that technique works by overlap, not juxtaposition. It is this mismatch that makes me uncertain what positive lessons Empedocles' analogy can provide us about the painter's method of combining colors. It is possible that Aristotle and Galen are right that the Empedoclean combination of elements should be understood on the model of juxtaposition \emph{and} that Wright has correctly interpreted the painter's combination of colors in terms of overlaying washes of different colors. In which case, the analogy, considered by itself, could serve only to establish the original negative lesson. The combination of the elements is like the combination of the colors in that neither should be understood in terms of blending or mixture. Rather, as it turns out, they work on the models of juxtaposition and overlap, respectively.

How does the combination of elements in various proportions result in the colors of things as they appear in sensory experience? According to Aëtius, four colors---white, black, red, and yellow (the Greek four-color palette)---are assigned to the elements, though Aëtius does not say which color belongs with which element. Partly on this basis some commentators attribute to Empedocles the view that the four elements have four unique colors (\citealt[217]{Cherniss:1935fk}, \citealt[152-3]{Siegel:1959fk}). This would be the basis of the desired explanation if the colors of compound bodies were explained in terms of the colors of their constituent elements. Notice that, on such an explanation, white, black, red, and yellow would be the primary colors---the view that Theophrastus criticizes Democritus for holding.  However, the fragments as they come down to us provide no direct support for this interpretation \citep[see][]{Ierodiakonou:2005fk}. While Empedocles claims that fire is white and water is black, no specific colors are associated with the other elements. 

I believe that it is more likely that Empedocles is following Parmenides in taking white and black or light and dark as the primary colors. As we will see, this interpretation coheres well with Theophrastus' account of Empedocles' theory of color vision. To illustrate this alternative, let us consider two fragments where Empedocles' associates white with fire and black with water.


In \emph{De Anima} (410\( ^{a} \)1), Aristotle cites the following Empedoclean fragement:
\begin{verse}
    And pleasant earth in her well-built channels\\
    received two parts of gleaming Nestis out of the eight\\
    and four of Hephaistos; and they become white bones\\
    fitted together with the divine glues of harmony.\\
    (DK \textsc{b}96; \citealt[62 245]{Inwood:2001ve})
\end{verse}
Aristotle's purpose was to illustrate the way in which compound bodies do not merely consist in their constituent elements, they must be combined in a certain proportion. Nestis is a Sicilian water-goddess, and Hephaistos is associated with fire. Thus, according to the fragment, bone is the result of Love's combining four parts fire with two parts earth and two parts water. Though some commentators take Nestis to refer to water and air, perhaps under the influence of the general conviction that all four elements are present in every compound body \citep[209 n2]{Wright:1981zr}. On this alternative interpretation, the proportion of elements in bone is four parts fire, two parts earth, one part water, and one part air. On either interpretation, Empedocles seems to be explaining the whiteness of bones in terms of the preponderance of fire in their constituent elements. If we combine this thought with the answer in the style of Gorgias presented in the \emph{Meno}, then the idea would be that bone, due to the preponderance of fire in its composition, gives off a fiery effluence. This fiery effluence, due to its distinctive magnitude, enters the fire passages in the membrane of the eye and so is palpable to sight. In this way the whiteness of the bone is manifest in sensory experience.

Plutarch cites the following fragment in answer to the question ``Why does the surface of the water look white and the depths look black?'' (\emph{Historia Naturalis} 39):
\begin{verse}
    And in the depths of the river a black colour is produced by the shadow,\\
    and in the same way it is observed in cavernous grottoes.\\
    (DK \textsc{b}94; \citealt[105 261]{Inwood:2001ve})
\end{verse}
