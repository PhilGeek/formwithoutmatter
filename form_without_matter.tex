\begin{quote}
	A signet produces a sealing, an impression that establishes the identity of its owner and consequently his authority, rights, and prerogaÂ­tives. When a sealing is placed on a document, especially for legal or official use, it authorizes the claims, obligations, promises, or orders made therein. A sealing thus differs from other impressions in that it \emph{purports to originate from a particular signet}. \citep[302]{Caston:2005cr}
