\label{cha:color}

Aristotle defines color as the power to move what is actually transparent (\emph{De Anima} \textsc{ii}.7 418\( ^{a} \)31--418\( ^{b} \)33; \textsc{ii}.7 419\( ^{a} \)10--12).

First, as \citet[367]{Hicks:1907uq} observes, by motion Aristotle does not mean locomotion or change in position. Rather, in \emph{De Anima}, \emph{kinēsis} is Aristotle's general term for change of any kind. Thus \emph{kinētikon} in Aristotle's definition means productive of change rather than productive of spatial movement, more narrowly.

Second, and frustratingly, Aristotle does not directly specify the nature of the change color induces in the transparent medium it acts upon. Indeed, in \emph{De Anima} \textsc{ii}.7 the only effect of color discussed is the effect in terms of which the transparent is defined---the transparent is not visible in itself, but \emph{owning its visibility to the color of another thing}. Is this change, the rendering visible of the transparent, sufficient to understand Aristotle's definition? If it is, this would explain Aristotle's apparent silence about the nature of the change induced in the transparent by color---he merely says nothing \emph{further}, having \emph{already} specified the nature of the change in his definition of the transparent. Given the paucity of textual evidence, a conservative strategy would begin with this hypothesis and only abandon it in favor of speculation should it prove to be an insufficient basis for understanding Aristotle's definition.

Third, a doubt may be registered about the occurrence of transparency in Aristotle's definition. Color is a proper object of sight, and, as such, partly defines the nature of sight. It might reasonably be thought that color could only play a role in defining sight if it had a nature independent of sight. But defining color in terms of the power to move what is actually transparent potentially threatens this order of explanation given the definitional connection between transparency and visibility. It is on these grounds that \citet{Zabarella:1605kx} rejects Aristotle's definition \citep[see][for discussion]{Broackes:1999uq}.

\section{The Generation of the Hues} % (fold)
\label{sec:the_generation_of_the_hues}

Aristotle's account of the generation of the hues may be surprising, but it would be wrong to prematurely dismiss it. It has ancient precedent. Thus when Theophrastus discusses Democritus's view that there are four primary colors, he contrasts it with the then dominant view that black and white are the two primary colors:
\begin{quote}
    But first of all, his increase of the number of primaries presents a difficulty; for the other investigators propose white and black as the only simple colours. (\emph{De Sensibus} 79; 68 A 135 DK; \citealt{Stratton:1917vn})
\end{quote}
Importantly, Empedocles is among the other investigators.

Not only does the view have ancient precedent, but it can be supported, to some degree, by empirical observation. 

In 1894, an English toy maker, Charles Benham, devised a top adorned with a black and white pattern (see Figure~\ref{fig:2}). Sold through Messrs. Newton and Co., an announcement of the ``Artificial Spectrum Top'' was published in \emph{Nature}:
	\begin{quote}
		The top consists of a disc, one half of which is black, while the other half has twelve arcs of concentric circles drawn upon it. Each arc subtends an angle of forty-five degrees. In the first quadrant there are three such concentric arcs, in the next three more, and so on; the only difference being that the arcs are parts of circles of which the radii increase in arithmetical progression. Each quadrant thus contains a group of arcs differing in length from those of the other quadrants. The curious point is that when this disc is revolved, the impression of concentric circles of different colors is produced upon the retina. If the direction of rotation is reversed, the order of these tints is also reversed. \citep{Benham:1894kx}
	\end{quote}
Specifically, if rotated clockwise, the innermost arcs form reddish rings, the next greenish rings, the next light blue rings, and the outermost arcs form violet rings. If rotated counterclockwise, the pattern is reversed with the innermost arcs now forming violet rings and the outermost reddish rings. The apparent colors of Benham's spinning disk are the ``subjective colors'' first described by \citep{Fechner:1838vn} and, hence, are also sometimes described as ``Fechner-Benham colors''.

Consider a puzzling aspect of the subjective colors of the Benham disk. Each of the spinning arcs reflect light with the same spectral content and with equal average luminance. In advance of observing the spinning disk, one might reasonably expect the spinning arcs to appear as gray rings of equal brightness. Why, then, do the rings appear reddish, greenish, light blue, and violet? The subjective colors of the Benham disk are not completely understood \citep[for a review of some of the color science see][]{Campenhausen:1995yq}. However, this much is clear: The innermost ring appearing reddish is the result of the visual system visually integrating temporal inhomogeneities presented by the spinning disk. Presentations of black and white stimuli altering at a particular temporal ratio elicits a chromatic response in normal human perceivers. 

This basic principle was used in a prototype of color television broadcasting \citep[]{Griffin:1968fk}. Developed by James F Butterfield, the broadcasting system consists of the Butterfield color encoder that produces a monochromatic signal which when broadcast and displayed on a monitor presents a chromatic appearance. The Butterfield encoder extracts a monochromatic signal from the colored scene by passing the light from the scene through cyan, magenta, and yellow filters. A colored object will appear black when seen through a filter of a complementary color. The filters themselves are arranged in a modified Benham Disk (see Figure~\ref{fig:3}).

    The Apollodorian accomplishment and that artist's importance in the art-historical record as it has come down to us from ancient times can only be explained if he was somehow able to synthesize earlier, less successful attempts, so that a systematic relationship between chiaroscuro and color was established in some consistent manner. Such an accomplishment and nothing les (when we consider the rather late fifth-century dates we must assume for the career of this artist) might have struck the imagination of the ancient viewer as anything so dramatic as an ``invention''. Then Zeuxis, who ``walked through the doors'' that his teacher, Apollodorus, had opened, must have been able to develop more sophisticated variations of the earlier methods. In his own mature work, he must have departed in some striking manner from the system of shading that had characterized his master's pictures; the likelihood is that Zeuxis inveented a kind of chiaroscuro in which the relationship of color to dark and light was definitely altered, in which shading assumed a more dominant role and the nuances of coloring and brushwork became more and more complex, perhaps more ``painterly''. \citep[29]{Bruno:1977fk}
