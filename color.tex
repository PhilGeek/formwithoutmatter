\label{cha:color}

Aristotle defines color as the power to move what is actually transparent (\emph{De Anima} \textsc{ii}.7 418\( ^{a} \)31--418\( ^{b} \)33; \textsc{ii}.7 419\( ^{a} \)10--12).

First, as \citet[367]{Hicks:1907uq} observes, by motion Aristotle does not mean locomotion or change in position. Rather, in \emph{De Anima}, \emph{kinēsis} is Aristotle's general term for change of any kind. Thus \emph{kinētikon} in Aristotle's definition means productive of change rather than productive of spatial movement, more narrowly.

Second, and frustratingly, Aristotle does not directly specify the nature of the change color induces in the transparent medium it acts upon. Indeed, in \emph{De Anima} \textsc{ii}.7 the only effect of color discussed is the effect in terms of which the transparent is defined---the transparent is not visible in itself, but \emph{owning its visibility to the color of another thing}. Is this change, the rendering visible of the transparent, sufficient to understand Aristotle's definition? If it is, this would explain Aristotle's apparent silence about the nature of the change induced in the transparent by color---he merely says nothing \emph{further}, having \emph{already} specified the nature of the change in his definition of the transparent. Given the paucity of textual evidence, a conservative strategy would begin with this hypothesis and only abandon it in favor of speculation should it prove to be an insufficient basis for understanding Aristotle's definition.

Third, a doubt may be registered about the occurrence of transparency in Aristotle's definition. Color is a proper object of sight, and, as such, partly defines the nature of sight. It might reasonably be thought that color could only play a role in defining sight if it had a nature independent of sight. But defining color in terms of the power to move what is actually transparent potentially threatens this order of explanation given the definitional connection between transparency and visibility. It is on these grounds that \citet{Zabarella:1605kx} rejects Aristotle's definition \citep[see][for discussion]{Broackes:1999uq}.

\section{The Generation of the Hues} % (fold)
\label{sec:the_generation_of_the_hues}

The presence of the fiery substance illuminates the potentially transparent me\-di\-um. White (\emph{leukon}) corresponds to the presence of this determinant of what is actually transparent. Conversely, black (\emph{melaton}) corresponds to its absence. The absence of the fiery substance darkens the potentially transparent medium. White and black are thus associated with a fundamental condition on the visibility of remote external particulars. No doubt in part because of this Aristotle attempts to explain the other hues in terms of the ratio of white and black. He considers three such accounts, in terms of (1) juxtaposition, (2) overlap, and (3) mixture, advocating the third. On all three accounts chromatic hues are determined by white and black in various ratios, the accounts differing only in how these ratios are implemented. The fundamental idea common to all three accounts can seem surprising. How can the ratio of white and black result in something appearing red? Would it not instead appear gray? Thus \citet[210]{Hett:1936fk} writes that Aristotle's ``doctrine could hardly have survived a few experiments with pigments''. Aristotle's account of the generation of the hues may be surprising, but it would be wrong to prematurely dismiss it. 

The first thing to observe is that \emph{leukon} and \emph{melaton} are better understood as light and dark, rather than white and black. There is a general tendency in Greek color vocabulary to classify colors in terms of relative brightness rather than hue \citep[see][]{Platnauer:1921bh,Lloyd:2007fk}. Traces of such a usage exist in English. Thus we speak of white wine and white people, though neither are white in hue. Similarly neither black people nor black grapes are black in hue. This usage in English, however, does not seem to be perfectly general but is rather lexically determined. It is not the case that for any noun \( N \), the occurrence of ``white'' in \( \ulcorner [white_{Adj}][N_{N}] \urcorner \) can be interpreted in terms of relative brightness instead of hue. The availability of such an interpretation seems to be limited to the adjective's application to certain nouns. The more general usage in Greek is philosophically significant, for it transforms Aristotle's claim. Aristotle is not claiming that the hues are determined by the ratio of white and black, but that they are determined by the ratio of light and dark. Experiments with pigment mixtures are irrelevant to the truth of this latter claim. Thus, Aristotle need not have risked Plato's charge of impiety as Hett recomends: 
\begin{quote}
    There will be no difficulty in seeing how and by what mixtures the colors derived from these are made according to the rules of probability. He, however, who should attempt to verify all this by experiment would forget the difference between human and divine nature. For God only has the knowledge and also the power which are able to combine many things into one and again resolve the one into many. But no man either is or ever will be able to accomplish either the one or the other operation. (\emph{Timaeus} 68d)
\end{quote}
Not only is the thought that the hues are determined by the ratio of light and dark not disconfirmable by impious experimentation, it is independently plausible. Indeed, as I will argue below, it is an ancient prefiguration of modern reflectance theories \citep[see][]{Hilbert:1987jq}.

Two further considerations are relevant. First, there are a range of observable phenomena that support Aristotle's fundamental claim that a ratio of white and black or (light and dark) can give rise to chromatic appearances. Importantly, Aristotle himself provides an example, though in a different context. Second, Aristotle's account has ancient precedent. Thus when Theophrastus discusses Democritus's view that there are four primary colors, he contrasts it with the then dominant view that white and black are the two primary colors:
\begin{quote}
    But first of all, his increase of the number of primaries presents a difficulty; for the other investigators propose white and black as the only simple colours. (\emph{De Sensibus} 79; 68 A 135 DK; \citealt{Stratton:1917vn})
\end{quote}
Arguably, Parmenides and Empedocles are among the other investigators who propose white and black as the only simple colors. Before discussing Aristotle's account of the generation of the hues, then, I will review some empirical support for its central idea, and will discuss the precedent for this doctrine in Parmenides and Empedocles.

In 1894, an English toy maker, Charles Benham, devised a top adorned with a black and white pattern (see Figure~\ref{fig:2}). Sold through Messrs. Newton and Co., an announcement of the ``Artificial Spectrum Top'' was published in \emph{Nature}:
	\begin{quote}
		The top consists of a disc, one half of which is black, while the other half has twelve arcs of concentric circles drawn upon it. Each arc subtends an angle of forty-five degrees. In the first quadrant there are three such concentric arcs, in the next three more, and so on; the only difference being that the arcs are parts of circles of which the radii increase in arithmetical progression. Each quadrant thus contains a group of arcs differing in length from those of the other quadrants. The curious point is that when this disc is revolved, the impression of concentric circles of different colors is produced upon the retina. If the direction of rotation is reversed, the order of these tints is also reversed. \citep{Benham:1894kx}
	\end{quote}
Specifically, if rotated clockwise, the innermost arcs form reddish rings, the next greenish rings, the next light blue rings, and the outermost arcs form violet rings. If rotated counterclockwise, the pattern is reversed with the innermost arcs now forming violet rings and the outermost reddish rings. The apparent colors of Benham's spinning disk are the ``subjective colors'' first described by \citep{Fechner:1838vn} and, hence, are also sometimes described as ``Fechner-Benham colors''.

Consider a puzzling aspect of the subjective colors of the Benham disk. Each of the spinning arcs reflect light with the same spectral content and with equal average luminance. In advance of observing the spinning disk, one might reasonably expect the spinning arcs to appear as gray rings of equal brightness. Why, then, do the rings appear reddish, greenish, light blue, and violet? The subjective colors of the Benham disk are not completely understood \citep[for a review of some of the color science see][]{Campenhausen:1995yq}. However, this much is clear: The innermost ring appearing reddish is the result of the visual system integrating temporal inhomogeneities presented by the spinning disk. Presentations of black and white stimuli altering at a particular temporal ratio elicits a chromatic response in normal human perceivers. 

This basic principle was used in a prototype color television broadcasting system \citep[]{Butterfield:1968uq,Butterfield:1970kx}. Developed by James F. Butterfield (who studied philosophy at the University of Chicago as an undergraduate), the broadcasting system consists of the Butterfield color encoder that produces a monochromatic signal that when broadcast and displayed on a black-and-white monitor presents a chromatic appearance. The Butterfield encoder extracts a monochromatic signal from the colored scene by passing the light from the scene through cyan, magenta, and yellow filters. The filters themselves are arranged in, what is in effect, a modified Benham Disk (see Figure~\ref{fig:3}). The bottom half of the filter is opaque with the colored filters fanned across the top half. The filters thus form a disk which is rotated. A colored object will appear black when seen through a filter of a complementary color. This and the opaque half of the rotating disk produces a pulsed black-and-white signal that elicits a chromatic response in normal human perceivers. The system produced good skin tones but unmixed hues, especially red, tended to flicker. The initial public demonstration was, by all accounts, startling:
\begin{quote}
    When electronic color was first publicly demonstrated in the Los Angeles area over KNXT, no prior announcement had been made at the request of a soft-drink manufacturer sponsoring the test. The beverage firm wanted its color commercials to be a complete surprise to viewers of black-and-white receivers. And, the telecasts were that, to say the very least. Within hours of the electronic-color broadcast, thousands of viewers began asking the same question, ``What happened? Did I really see color on my black-and-white receiver? Or am I having hallucinations?'' \citep[]{Griffin:1968fk}
\end{quote}
The power to demand such attention did not go unnoticed. The final public demonstration was an Eva Perón political advertisement.

\end{figure}

That the pulsed black-and-white signal produced by the Butterfield color encoder gives rise to a chromatic appearance is once again the result of the visual system integrating temporal inhomogeneities. However, these temporal inhomogeneities are not the result of spatial movement of the object of perception, but rather due to the qualitative alterations over time of a stationary object. Each involves the presentation of white and black stimuli altering at a particular temporal ratio eliciting a chromatic response in normal human perceivers. They differ in how that temporal ratio is implemented---by the motion of an object whose parts qualitatively differ or by the qualitative alteration over time of a stationary object. 

Stated so abstractly it is easy to see that there is a third possibility. If the temporal ratio that determines a given chromatic appearance can be implemented by the motion of a black and white object, the perceivers motion relative to a black and white object should do so as well \citep[72]{Hardin:1993kn}. And indeed it can. Our eyes constantly scan the scene with involuntary saccades. Scanning a stationary black and white object can give rise to chromatic appearance. Thus Sorabji claims that certain Bridget Riley paintings are an example:
\begin{quote}
    The English painter, Bridget Riley, has produced pictures in which black and white are juxtaposed, in long ribbons \ldots\ When people look at these black and white ribbons, many are able to see all sorts of colours appearing. \citep[295]{Sorabji:2022qf}
\end{quote}
These chromatic appearances are the result of the visual system integrating temporal inhomogeneities that result from the eye involuntarily moving across a stationary black and white object.

These examples involve artifacts, and sometimes technology, unavailable at Aristotle's time. And while they may serve to make plausible for \emph{us} that ratios of white and black or light and dark can give rise to chromatic appearances, they could not have done so for Aristotle. What empirical observation available to Aristotle could have made vivid for him the possibility that chromatic appearances are the result of the ratio of light and dark in the perceived scene? \citet[294]{Sorabji:2022qf} makes the ingenious suggestion that an example discussed in the last chapter could give rise to the relevant experience. The sun is white, but it appears red when seen through fog or a cloud of smoke (\emph{De Sensu} 3 440\( ^{a} \)10--11). The white of the sun, when superimposed by black particles, gives rise to a red appearance. While the previous examples all involve the visual system integrating temporal inhomogeneities, in the present example, the visual system must integrate spatial inhomogeneities that result from black particles being suspended in a medium suffused with white light. These spatial inhomogeneities give rise to a ratio of white and black or light and dark that determine a red appearance. 

In this regard, understood in this way, seeing the sun through smoke filled medium is like seeing a pointillist painting. Fascinated by the appearance of a color being influenced by adjacent colors, Pierre Seurat eventually paints the pointillist masterpiece, “Un dimanche après-midi à l'Île de la Grande Jatte” in 1884--6. Using only primary unblended pigments, including the newly available zinc yellow, these were distributed in small dots across the surface of the canvas giving rise to the appearance, at an appropriate distance, of a differently colored scene of Parisian suburbanites relaxing by the river Seine. This latter appearance is due, in part, to the visual system integrating spatial inhomogeneities presented by the multicolored surface (see \citealt[71--72]{Hardin:1993kn} and \citealt[156--158]{Johnston:1992ck}). Thus, it is not just that temporal ratios give rise to chromatic appearances no matter how they are implemented, the relevant ratios need not be temporal. They could be spatial as in Aristotle's example or as in the case of Seurat's masterpiece.

Theophrastus (\emph{De Sensibus} 79; DK 68\textsc{a}135) alludes to a pre-Deomocritean tradition according to which white and black are the primary colors, the colors in terms of which all other colors are to be explained. Arguably, Parmenides and Empedocles belong to this pre-Democritean tradition (though the latter is controversial).

In the prologue to his poem, the goddess promises to reveal to Parmenides two things, the Way of Truth and the Way of Mortal Opinion. The latter she assures him is false; nevertheless, Parmenides must learn these too (DK 28\textsc{b}1 31). The Way of Mortal opinion is an account of the world ``as it appears'' (DK 28\textsc{b}8 60; \citealt[155]{McKirahan:1994ve}), and the goddess presents it to Parmenides ``so that no mortal opinion may ever overtake'' him (DK 28\textsc{b}8 61; \citealt[155]{McKirahan:1994ve}). The Way of Mortal opinion is a cosmology in the Milesian tradition, though Parmenides is not expounding the views of any particular Milesian cosmologist \citep[on Parmenides and Milesian cosmology see][]{Kahn:1994qf}. Rather, he is presenting what is, by his lights, the best account that can be given along those lines. Traditional Milesian cosmologies tend to be monistic, but the Way of Mortal opinion posits two fundamental and irreducible principles that stand in opposition, ``fire'' and ``night'' or light and dark (DK 28\textsc{b}8 53--61, 28\textsc{b}9). The thought seems to be this. Having shown that the true monism of the Way of Truth is inconsistent with appearances, the Way of Mortal Opinion must posit a plurality of principles in opposition, if it is to accommodate the plurality and opposition encountered in the world as it appears. 

\begin{verse}
    For they made up their minds to name two forms,\\ 
    Of which it is not right to name one---in this they have gone astray---\\
    And they distinguished things opposite in body, and established signs\\
    Apart from one another---for one, the aetherial fire of flame,\\
    Mild, very light, the same as itself in every direction,\\
    But not the same as the other; but that other one, in itself\\
    Is opposite---dark night, a dense and heavy body.\\
    I declare to you all the ordering as it appears,\\
    So that no mortal opinion may ever overtake you.
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}
    But since all things have been named light and night\\
    And the things which accord with their posers have been assigned to these things and those,\\
    All is full of light and obscuring night together,\\
    of both equally, since neither has no share.\\
    (Parmenides, DK 28\textsc{b}8 53--9 4; \citealt[155]{McKirahan:1994ve})
\end{verse}
Like that which is of the Way of Truth, the two principles, fire and night, of the Way of Mortal Opinion, have attributes called ``signs''. Like fire and night itself, the attributes of these principles stand in opposition. Fire is bright, night is dark; fire is lightweight, night is heavy, and so on. Fire and night may have further attributes not listed here; much of the Way of Mortal Opinion is missing. A sense of the scope of its ambition, however, is provided by Plutarch:
\begin{quote}
    But Parmenides for one has abolished neither `fire' nor `water', neither `a precipice' nor `cities lying in Europe and Asia' in Colotes' words, since he has actually made a cosmic order, and by blending as elements the light and the dark produces out of them and by their operation the whole world of sense. Thus he has much to say about earth, heaven, sun, moon, and stars, and has recounted the genesis of man; and for an ancient natural philosopher---who has put together a book of his own, and is not pulling apart the book of another---he has left nothing of real importance unsaid. (Plutarch, \emph{Adversus Colotem} 1114 b--c; \citealt[231]{Einarson:1967zr})

    The Apollodorian accomplishment and that artist's importance in the art-historical record as it has come down to us from ancient times can only be explained if he was somehow able to synthesize earlier, less successful attempts, so that a systematic relationship between chiaroscuro and color was established in some consistent manner. Such an accomplishment and nothing les (when we consider the rather late fifth-century dates we must assume for the career of this artist) might have struck the imagination of the ancient viewer as anything so dramatic as an ``invention''. Then Zeuxis, who ``walked through the doors'' that his teacher, Apollodorus, had opened, must have been able to develop more sophisticated variations of the earlier methods. In his own mature work, he must have departed in some striking manner from the system of shading that had characterized his master's pictures; the likelihood is that Zeuxis inveented a kind of chiaroscuro in which the relationship of color to dark and light was definitely altered, in which shading assumed a more dominant role and the nuances of coloring and brushwork became more and more complex, perhaps more ``painterly''. \citep[29]{Bruno:1977fk}
